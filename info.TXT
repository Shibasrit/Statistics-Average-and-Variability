Finding the Two Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Product

In this project, we tried find the two best markets to advertise our product in, for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of the courses are on web and mobile development, but some other domains, like data science, game development, etc are also covered.

Understanding the Data

To avoid spending money on organizing a survey, existing data to determine whether we can reach any reliable result is used from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey. freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of the analysis.
