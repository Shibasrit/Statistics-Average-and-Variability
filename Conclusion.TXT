Conclusion

In this project, survey data from new coders is analyzed to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.

For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. It's decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
